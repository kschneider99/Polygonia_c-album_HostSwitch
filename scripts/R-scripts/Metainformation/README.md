The Metainformation (including e.g. sample ID, Host plant treatment, sampling timepoint, etc.) for each Switch experiment (A and B) is provided in two separate files. 
Switch A included technical replicates that were combined during the downstream analysis in EdgeR. Adjusted lists with Metainformation for the combined replicates created manually and read in in later steps of the analysis.
The adjusted files are called Meta_1_2... and Meta_1_17_notechrep.
